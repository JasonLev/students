// Complete the following functions:

// 1.  Square Root:
// this function should take an input (a number) and output its square Root;
// You are given almost the complete function, just provide a way to get the ouput (hint: return) of the function
function squareRoot(n) {
  var result = Math.sqrt(n);
  //Your code goes on the line below here

  //Your code goes on the line above
}

// Test the squareRoot function with this:
squareRoot(144); //should output 12

// ***********************************
// 2.  Addition:
// this function should take two inputs (two numbers) and output the sum of them;
// You are given almost the complete function, just provide a way to get the ouput (hint: return) of the function
function addition(x,y) {
  var sum = x + y;
  //Your code goes on the line below here

  //Your code goes on the line above
}

// Test the addition function with this:
addition(38, 21); //should output 59

// ***********************************
// 3.  Subtraction:
// this function should take two inputs (two numbers) and output the difference of them (first input subtract the second input);
// You are given a little less this time, you should complete creating a variable to compute the math and then provide a way to get the ouput (hint: return) of the function
function subtraction(x,y) {
  //Your code goes on the lines below here
  var difference =            // <-- do the math here

  //Your code goes on the lines above
}

// Test the subtraction function with this:
subtraction(38, 21); //should output 59

// ***********************************
// 4.  Multiplication:
// this function should take two inputs (two numbers) and output the product of them;
// You are given even little less this time, you should create a variable to compute the math and then provide a way to get the ouput (hint: return) of the function
function multiplication(x,y) {
  //Your code goes on the lines below here


  //Your code goes on the lines above
}

// Test the multiplication function with this:
multiplication(10, 17); //should output 170

// ***********************************
// 5.  Division:
// this function should take two inputs (two numbers) and output the quotient of them;
// You should complete the whole thing by writing the entire function out...
  //Your code goes on the lines below here




  //Your code goes on the lines above

// Test the division function with this:
division(540, 18); //should output 30



// ***********************************
// Bonus:
// create a function that is a "mash up math" of your other functions;
// this function should take two inputs (two numbers) and compute a mathematical operation on the inputs (either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), then the function continues by computing another operation on the inputs (don't repeat, pick a different operation), then the function computes yet another operation (again, different from the first two operations) and uses the results of the first operations as inputs
// You should complete the whole thing by writing the entire function out...
  //Your code goes on the lines below here






  //Your code goes on the lines above

// Test the division function with this:
mashUpMath(10, 4); //if you pick addition, subtraction, and multiplication... should output 84
